I am Suchita Pal and recently I did PG-Diploma in Big Data Analytics from CDAC(IACSD) Pune.   
Prior to this I have completed M.Sc. in Physics from Mumbai University.   
It would be great if I can get a chance to showcase my skills learnt in CDAC.   
I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set, 
as continuing to learn new languages and development techniques are important to me and the success of your organization.
